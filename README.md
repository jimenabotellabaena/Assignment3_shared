[![Review Assignment Due Date](https://classroom.github.com/assets/deadline-readme-button-22041afd0340ce965d47ae6ef1cefeee28c7c493a6346c4f15d667ab976d596c.svg)](https://classroom.github.com/a/pb6QouxK)
## Instructions for completing the assignment
* Congratulations, you successfully started the assignment!
* Clone this repo to your local machine (or a hosted service such as Google Colab)
* Answer the questions in the notebook 'Assignment_3_2025.ipynb'
* You can run things in scripts, but then copy the code back into the notebook
* Make sure that all answers are self-contained. Define additional variables and helper functions inside the functions you are asked to implement. Never use global variables except the ones that we defined (e.g. X, y)!
* Your notebook should run top-to-bottom (e.g. run 'Restart kernel and run all cells'), and finish within 60 minutes.
* Push your solution to Github Classroom. Make sure that you commit everything, especially your assignment notebook. As usual:

```
git add -A
git commit -m "commit message"
git push
```

### Self-verification
* An automated unit test will be run automatically on GitHub. This basically tries to run your notebook top to bottom again. Check your github page to follow status. An orange dot means it is still running, a green check means that everything is fine.
* If the automated test fails (you see a red cross), click it to check what went wrong. Under `submission_test` you will find the notbook output including the error message. 
* If there is an error, this does not automatically mean that your solution is wrong. There can be other unexpected reasons as well. 
* Note that after the deadline, submission to GitHub will no longer be possible.
